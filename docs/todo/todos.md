# Possible Extensions for Herakleitos Project

## 🔹 1. Time Series & Forecasting Enhancements
- **Forecasting models** (Prophet, ARIMA, NeuralProphet, AutoTS, etc.) → “Forecast conversions or revenue for the next 30 days.”
- **Anomaly Detection** (residual-based, ADTK, Kats, Isolation Forest) → “Detect unusual spikes in CTR.”
- **Change Point Detection** (e.g., ruptures, Bayesian changepoint) → “Identify when trends or seasonality shifted.”
- **Seasonality Clustering** → Group campaigns or products with similar time-series patterns.

## 🔹 2. NLP & Semantic Analysis
- **Topic Modeling / Clustering** → Automatically extract themes from queries, logs, or feedback.
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Analyze customer reviews or campaign text for sentiment trends.
- **Keyword Extraction** → Detect the most relevant features or terms in text data.

## 🔹 3. Feature Engineering Utilities
- **Lagged Feature Generation** → Create lag and rolling-window features for time-series models.
- **Interaction Features** → Automatically generate and test feature interactions.
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment** → Identify and treat anomalies using z-score, IQR, or Isolation Forest.

## 🔹 4. Model Monitoring & Explainability
- **Drift Detection** → Monitor distribution shifts between training and live data.
- **Counterfactual Explanations** (e.g., Alibi, DiCE) → “What if ad spend increased by 20%?”
- **Global vs Local Explainability Dashboards** → SHAP + PDP (Partial Dependence Plots) + ICE (Individual Conditional Expectation).

## 🔹 5. Causal Inference Extensions
- **Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) Estimation** → “Which customer segments benefit more from treatment?”
- **Meta-Learners** (T-Learner, S-Learner, X-Learner) wrappers for treatment effect modeling.
- **Sensitivity Analysis** → Evaluate robustness of causal inference to hidden confounders.

## 🔹 6. Cross-Agent Pipelines
- **Hybrid Analysis** → Chain EDA → SHAP → Causal analysis in one query.
- **Recommendation Agent** → Synthesize EDA, A/B testing, and causal results into actionable next steps.

## 🔹 7. Visualization & Dashboards
- **Interactive Dashboards** with Plotly / Altair / Streamlit.
- **Automated EDA Reports** (via ydata-profiling or sweetviz) for dataset summaries.
- **Custom Visualization Agent** → Generate plots based on query intent (histograms, scatterplots, causal graphs).

## 🔹 8. Data Source Integrations
- **SQL Connectors** (Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake) → Query data directly from databases.
- **Ad Platform APIs** (Google Ads, Meta Ads) → Pull campaign data for real-time analysis.
- **Cloud Storage Connectors** (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) → Load files seamlessly.

---

- **Short-term**: Anomaly Detection + Change Point Detection → strong value for monitoring.  
- **Medium-term**: HTE estimation + drift detection → makes it a true production-grade analytics toolkit.  
- **Long-term**: Interactive dashboards + connectors → positions the project as a versatile analytics product.
